# ChangeLog

## v0.0.2

**Released: WiP**

- Typing a directory into the input control of the `FileOpen` dialog now
  changes the directory in the navigator and stays within the dialog.
- Sprinkled some `PermissionError`-handling code around the `FileOpen`
  dialog, so that if the user tries to go where they don't belong, the
  application won't blow up.

## v0.0.1

**Released: 2023-05-18**

Initial release.
